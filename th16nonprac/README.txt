How to use:
this patch replaces spells in spell practice with nonspells. Every nonspell except Eternity midboss is available. List of which nonspell replaces which spell:
- eternity midboss non - not available due to not enough slots (use spoilerAL midboss warp if you REALLY want to practise this non I guess)
- eternity boss nons - 1st and 2nd non replace 1st and 2nd spell on stage 1 respectively.
- nemuno midboss non - replaces 1st spell on stage 2.
- nemuno boss nons - 1st and 2nd non replace 2nd and 3rd spell on stage 2 respectively.
- lily white midboss non - replaces 1st spell on stage 3. Because the spell doesn't exist on easy/normal, it's not possible to practice this non on these difficulties using this patch.
- aunn boss nons - 1st, 2nd, and 3rd non replace 2st, 3rd and 4th spell on stage 3 respectively.
- mai midboss non - replaces 1st spell **on stage 5**.
- narumi nons - 1st, 2nd and 3rd non replace 1st, 2nd and 3rd spell on stage 4 respectively.
- satono midboss non - replaces 2nd spell on stage 5.
- satono & mai nons - 1st, 2nd and 3rd non replace 3rd, 4th and 5th spell on stage 5 respectively.
- okina s6 nons - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th non replace 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th spell on stage 6 respectively.
- okina ex nons - 1st, 2nd, [...], 7th and 8th non replace 4th, 5th, [...], 10th and 11th spell on the extra stage respectively.

Notes:
nemuno, mai and satono midboss nons don't end correctly (boss just disappears after hp reaches 0). Idk how to fix it, I tried. Maybe I can fix it in a later version.
