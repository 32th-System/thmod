--- VD LoLK patch 1.0a by Priw8 ---
You should probably use a save file that has all the upgrades unlocked.
Sumireko's full power shottype has been modified to deal more damage (the damage in VD was quite tiny). The unfocused shot was also made homing, because stage 5 is stupid without it. 

- Monday scene 1 - LoLK stage 1
- Monday scene 2 - LoLK stage 1 boss
- Tuesday scene 1 - LoLK stage 2
- Tuesday scene 2 - LoLK stage 2 boss
- Wednesday scene 2 - LoLK stage 3 (scene 1 is hardcoded to show teleporting tutorial when you die)
- Wednesday scene 3 - LoLK stage 3 boss
- Thursday scene 1 - LoLK stage 4
- Thursday scene 2 - LoLK stage 4 boss
- Friday scene 1 - LoLK stage 5
- Friday scene 2 - LoLK stage 5 boss
- Wrong Friday scene 1 - LoLK stage 6 (blah blah hardcoded jank, making Junko work in other scenes would be annoying)
- Wrong Friday scene 2 - LoLK stage 6 boss

All of these are lunatic difficulty.

Things that are yet to be done:
- fix Ringo's 2nd spell and Clownpiece's 3rd spell. They use some hardcoded functions that don't exist in LoLK anymore. 
- add extra stage
- add normal mode version

Not sure when I'll do them.

Music is unchanged because it's not possible to use that many tracks in VD, sorry. You can mute the ingame music and play the correct one on youtube or whatever...
